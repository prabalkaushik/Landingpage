# Fabricom Metals Landing Page

This project contains a simple landing page called **Busines** for Fabricom Metals.
It is built with Node.js and Express to serve a static website with a contact form.

## Getting Started

   ```bash
   npm install

The contact form collects a name, contact number, email address and a note or query.
Form submissions are logged to the server console and a thank you message is shown
on the page.
